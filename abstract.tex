Because embedded interpreters offer flexibility and performance, they are
becoming more prevalent.  They can be found at nearly every level of the
software stack. For example, some kernel defines languages to describe packet
filtering rules and uses embedded interpreters to filter packets at runtime. RAR
allows embedding bytecode in compressed RAR files to describe reversible
transformations, which are interpreted and applied by RAR decompressor.

As embedded interpreters are used more widely, it is increasingly important to
avoid common pitfalls, in particular ones that can lead to security
vulnerabilities.  This paper presents an analysis of bugs found in embedded
interpreters and their effects.  The results are useful both in augmenting
existing embedded interpreters and aid developers in building new, more secure
embedded interpreters.
